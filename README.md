# Quantitative_Single_cell_Biology
This is the course project of Quantitative Single cell biology at VU, I applied both theoretical and practical aspects of modern single-cell analysis methods, including single-molecule RNA imaging, fluorescent protein tagging, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry.And also engaged in computer practicals, utilizing custom-written Python code to analyze single-cell data, focusing on the eukaryotic microorganism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I explored how single-cell microorganisms adapt to changing environments, addressing concepts such as fitness optimization, gene expression noise, adaptation of metabolism, and population heterogeneity.
